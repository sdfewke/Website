<p><span id="headertext">Awkward introduction? Clammy handshake? No thanks, let’s try a virtual bear hug and a quick two-minute spiel about who I am, because who I am is your new go-to man – a dean's list creative technologies student with 6+ years of work experience and soon a degree in creative technologies at Illinois State University.</span></p>
<div id="maintext">
<p>As a creative technologies student, I have gotten to experience many different areas of the creative arts ranging from audio to pixel art. My main focus is on video game development, which is where I spend most of my time. About 2 years ago I started messing around with Unity and thus my passion was born. Since then I have managed to find myself learning as much as I can about both Unity and Unreal engine.</p>
<p>I have a ways to go before I have mastered either of the engines, but I can't say the journey isn't fun! I am also a part of Illinois State's Game Development Club, so I have a few games under my belt. Though the university I have learned C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In my free time is where I started teaching myself some C++ as well as the Unreal engine. My resume might not be the best you've ever seen, but I promise you won't find a more devoted person around. - Sam</p>
