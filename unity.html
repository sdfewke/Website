<p>With About 2 years of work experience with Unity I know my fair share about the engine. On this page you'll get to see some of the projects I've done over the past few semesters. While none of these projects are full games, they do show some of the knowledge I've gained while using the engine. Enjoy!</p>

<div id="untexturedtext">
<p>This project was done in my VR game development class, our job was to make a scene only using unity's standard 3D shapes. As you can see I made a very simple house with an adjusted skybox to match the color of the grass. I also adjusted the directional light to act more like the sun, while also enabling shadows!</p>

<div id="texturedtext">
<p>Shortly after creating the first assignment we were tasked with adding materials to our shapes to add more detail. Unity much like Unreal engine has an asset store where you can download community made assets to add to your project, so I browsed over some asset packs and added the materials to my project!</p>

<div id="lightingtext">
<p>In this assignment we were given a box with a directional light. We had to manipulate the light to change the scene, so I added UI to change between the different scenes. After adding the UI I went ahead and moved the main camera on one scene to get a different view, as well as removing the directional light for a spot lights. I also made a torch have light in another scene!</p>

<div id="coursetext">
<p>This assignment was an accumulation of all that we had learned thus far. I made an obstacle course of sorts that utilized a first person controller. I added sound effects for the jump/landing as well as the walking and running. After I had a working character controller I moved on to creating the course, where I added a custom skybox as well as flared lights all around the course!</p>

<div id="marbletext">
<p>In this project the focus was on ProBuilder and physics! I utilized ProBuilder to create the marble course you see in the video, ProBuilder allows the user to create highly detailed shapes to use for level design. After creating the level I added a custom skybox as well as the marble. I then added materials to all of my game objects and added a third person controller to the ball!</p>

<p>I have done a lot more with unity than you see just on this page. If you want to see more head on over to the <a href="freetime.html">Freetime</a> Page or reach out to me via any of the platforms on the left! Thanks for reading!</p>
